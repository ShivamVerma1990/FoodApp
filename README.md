# FoodApp
 Its a basicaly a food application just like zomato!!😊
 In this application i provided some features just like user can see his/her order history and user can add his/her food or remove his/her food according its choise and user also like his favorite restaurant  just like Spotify😃
 👩‍💻Technology that i used in this application 
I used Room Persistence Library for storing user information
I also used Volley Library for acessing data from the server 🤗 
And Volley is an HTTP library that makes networking very easy and fast, for Android apps. It was developed by Google😇
